Lofi Cafe
A peaceful, lo-fi idle game set in a cosy coffee shop, developed using Next.js and PixiJS. This project emphasises relaxing gameplay, gradual resource gathering, and gentle NPC interactions, all wrapped in a mellow, atmospheric style.

Project Overview
Lofi Cafe is designed to be a small, calming idle experience. Watch a miniature coffee shop come to life on your screen, with baristas serving a slow trickle of customers, resources accumulating over time, and subtle animations fostering a serene mood.

Why build this?
Calm Gameplay: Promotes a relaxed approach—no time limits or stressful management tasks.
AI-Driven NPCs (Planned): Simple memory systems that let customers and baristas evolve their interactions gradually.
Easy to Run: Built on Next.js, so you can deploy it quickly or run it locally on various devices.


Features & Goals
Lo-Fi Aesthetic: Minimalistic visuals, soft colour palettes, and soothing music.
Idle Resource Loop: Earn ‘coffee beans’, ‘tips’, or similar currencies over time.
NPC Behaviour (Early Stage): Customers arrive periodically, generating resources.


Future Plans:
Deeper AI with memory-based personality traits.
Day/night cycles reacting to real-world time.
Expandable café areas or new scenarios.































This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
